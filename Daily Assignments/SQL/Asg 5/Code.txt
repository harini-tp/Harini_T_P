Subqueries and corelated sub queries
----------------------------------------

1. Write a SQL query to find those employees who receive a higher salary than the employee with ID 7566. Return their names

2. Write a SQL query to find out which employees have the same designation as the employee whose ID is 7876. Return name, department no and job .

3. Write a SQL query to find those employees who report to that manager whose name starts with a 'B' or 'C'. Return first name, employee ID and salary

4. Use Northwid database to solve :
   a) Find products that are more expensive than the average price of products in their own category. Include the category name, product name, and unit price in the result.

   b) For each category, display its name, the number of discontinued products in this category (discontinued), and the number of all products in this category 







SELECT * FROM EMP
SELECT * FROM DEPT


--1
SELECT empno, ename, sal FROM EMP
WHERE sal > (
			SELECT sal FROM EMP 
			WHERE empno = 7566)


--2
SELECT ename, deptno, job FROM EMP 
WHERE job = (
			SELECT job FROM EMP
			WHERE empno = 7876)


--3
SELECT ename, empno, sal FROM EMP 
WHERE mgrid IN(
				SELECT empno FROM EMP t1
				WHERE ename LIKE '[BC]%')



SELECT * FROM Products

SELECT * FROM Categories

--Northwind
--a
SELECT CategoryName, ProductName, UnitPrice 
FROM Products P1
JOIN Categories 
ON P1.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID
WHERE UnitPrice > (SELECT AVG(UnitPrice) FROM Products P2
					WHERE P2.CategoryID = P1.CategoryID)




--b
SELECT CategoryName, [Number of Disc. product],[Total no of products] FROM Categories C
JOIN (
	SELECT COUNT(ProductName) [Number of Disc. product], CategoryID FROM Products
	GROUP BY CategoryID) X
ON C.CategoryID = X.CategoryID 
JOIN(
	SELECT COUNT(ProductID) [Total no of products], CategoryID FROM Products
	GROUP BY CategoryID) Y
ON C.CategoryID = Y.CategoryID
